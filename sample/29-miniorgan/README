This sample is a simple monophonic mini organ. You have to attach an USB PC
keyboard to your Raspberry Pi to use it. The output signal is available on the
3.5mm headphones jack.

The mini organ uses the PWM sound device to generate a square wave of the
required frequency for one octave (note C4 to B4). A more complex sound
synthesis using the CPWMSoundDevice2 class should be possible.

The keyboard mapping is as follows:

+--------+
|Key Note|
+--------+

   +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+-----+
   |S C#4|D D#4|     |G F#4|H G#4|J A#4|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|Z C4 |X D4 |C E4 |V F4 |B G4 |N A4 |M B4 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The inscription of the keyboard may vary, but the physical position of the
piano keys is the same on all keyboards. Using this scheme you should be able to
find them.
