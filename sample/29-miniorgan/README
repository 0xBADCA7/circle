README 

This sample is a simple monophonic mini organ. You have to attach an USB
keyboard to your Raspberry Pi to use it. The output signal is available on the
3.5mm headphone jack.

The mini organ uses the PWM sound device to generate a square wave of the
required frequency for one octave (note C4 to B4). A more complex sound
synthesis using the CPWMSoundDevice2 class should be possible.

The keyboard mapping is as follows:

+--------+
|Key Note|
+--------+

   +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+-----+
   |S C#4|D D#4|     |G F#4|H G#4|J A#4|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|Z C4 |X D4 |C E4 |V F4 |B G4 |N A4 |M B4 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Please note that the 'Z' key (note C4) is actually the 'Y' key on some
keyboards.
