README

This sample is a simple terminal program for the serial interface UART0. You
need an USB keyboard and some serial interface adapter to use it. Connect the
device of your choice to your Raspberry Pi as follows (Broadcom numbering):

Raspberry Pi		Device

TXD / GPIO14	<--->	RXD
RXD / GPIO15	<--->	TXD
GND		<--->	GND

Please note that the Raspberry Pi uses 3.3V levels on the TXD / RXD pins.

If you need an interface speed different to 115200 bits per second, you can
change the BAUDRATE define in the file kernel.cpp before building the sample.

A keyboard translation map is used to translate the physical key code into the
right ASCII code or in an escape sequence for special keys (see the file
doc/keyboard.txt). There are six of these language-depended maps at the moment
(UK English, Spanish, French, Italian, US International and German). Select the
wanted map at the end of the file include/circle/sysconfig.h before building
(default map) or by using the file cmdline.txt (e.g. "keymap=UK"). If you press
Ctrl-Alt-Del the terminal reboots.
