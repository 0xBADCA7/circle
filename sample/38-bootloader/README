README

This sample program is a TFTP boot loader. When the sample is running, you can
send an other kernel*.img file via the local network to the Raspberry Pi and
automatically start it in memory. The kernel image is not written out to the SD
card. You need an TFTP client installed on your host computer to do this. Enter
the following command to send the kernel image:

	tftp -m binary ip_address -c put kernel.img

ip_address is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi and is displayed on the
screen. The file name of the kernel image may be slightly different, depending
on your project settings.

Please note that there may be a "Transfer timed out" message on your Raspberry
Pi, before the transfer runs and completes successfully. This is normal and can
be ignored.


This sample program is a HTTP based boot loader too. Open the following URL in
a web browser on your host computer and follow the instructions in the browser
window:

	http://ip_address:8080/


If you want to include the boot loader support into your own application, please
note that:

* The chain boot mechanism is not supported for multi-core applications.

* The accelerated graphics support cannot be restored after chain boot.

* The Act LED does not work on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B after chain boot,
  if it was enabled before. The same is valid for the Compute Module 3(+).
  That's why the Act LED is not used in this sample.

* Some devices are not reset in the destructors of their driver classes.
  This may cause problems with some devices. The devices used in this sample
  should work in any way.

* The source file main.cpp of this sample is slightly different from that,
  which is used in other sample programs.
